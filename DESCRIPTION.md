# The impact of Cancer-associated fibroblast in primary non-small cell lung cancer stem cell   
Lin, Ting-Wei

## Biological Question
1. What's the impact of Cancer-associated fibroblast on the cancer stem cell transcriptom?
2. Which part of these impact determined the drug-resistant and migration characteristics in the lung cancer stem cell?
3. What hypothesis can be generated for these phenomenon from our data (microarray, RNAseq, Proteomics)


## Thinking on methology approach
1. How you deal with your microarray data?
2. How you deal with RNAseq data?
3. How you deal with the Proteomic data?
4. How you manage whole the project?
